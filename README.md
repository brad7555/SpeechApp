**Controlling My Speech**

I will start by saying that this is an app being created for stutterers (or people with speech impediments of any kind). Personally, I have been a stutterer for my entire life, and have spent many hours with speech pathologists, working tirelessly on my speaking ability. It is a grueling journey, where you spend much of your day trying to figure out something so simple like talking. Simply speaking for stutterers can feel like navigating an intricate maze. Going through speech therapy is hard, and doing it virtually is even harder. 

Ever since my very first speech session during quarantine, this idea has been stewing in my brain. There are many things that I would like to accomplish with this application but the main thing is making stutterers comfortable in every way possible. Let me be clear: This app is not to be a replacement for seeing a speech pathologist. If the speech session is the shot, then let this be the chaser. Dumb alcohal comparisons aside, it is meant to be a place where you can go after your session to continue improving and working on your craft.

Taking notes virtually, all while trying to focus on talking can be hard. I want to provide information about speech, so the client can learn supplemental knowledge outside of a session to optimize their speech experience. A big part of controlling your speech is recording yourself speaking, and playing it back to see how you sound, what you can improve on, and most importantly, what sounds good already! 

One thing I have learned over the past few months: sharing your audio recordings over zoom sucks! You either have to email them (which files can be too big) or play them from your phone over zoom (not cool). Even if you manage to email your audio files, the clinician still has to download them, store them on their computer, and match your relaxation rating, fluency rating, and notes you send them to the audio file. This is the main driving force behind my app. This is what caused me to start coding. I wanted a place where I could upload my audio files, along with the specific ratings, as well as some notes and have it be displayed on one single page. 
Now this is obviously the main feature, and the one I started with, but not the only one. I will outline the features later on, in a separate section, as this section has been long enough. I hope this gave you a little insight into my extreme passion behind this app, and a little of the direction where I want to take it. New ideas are always welcome!

**Coding Conventions**
I don't have too many preferences on conventions. 
  * Making sure your code is clean and commented
  * Write CSS and Javascript code in separate files, and link them
  * In databases, primary keys are to be named ID, and foreign keys are name ItemID. 
  * Using C# in the backend
